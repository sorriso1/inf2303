# Readings and Resources

The course will rely on readings that fall roughly into two categories.

* **Primary sources.** 
  Those are writings by people closely involved with free / open
    source software, which will give us a first-hand perspective on
    this phenomenon.
  We will be looking at writings by Richard Stallman, Linus Torvalds,
    and Eric Raymond, as well as a few others.
  When approaching such texts we will read them in the same way that
    primary texts are read in humanities, asking questions about the
    relationship between each text and the historical and cultural
    millieu in which it was written.
  Students should not be mislead by the seeming ease of such texts,
    and should try to dig deeper into them.
* **Academic analyses.**
  Those are academic writings either looking at free / open source
    software directly or exploring closely related topics such as
    copyright and history of software.
  Some of those texts can be quite challenging, as they may be
    positioned within academic debates the students may be unfamiliar
    with.
  Please budget your time accordingly.
